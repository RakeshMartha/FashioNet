# General Adversarial Networks
The main component of this project.
General Adversarial Networks or GANs is neural network system which contains two components i.e., a discriminator net and a generator net.\

### Discriminator
The discriminator net differentiates the images generated by the generator and the existing training set.
It classifies images as either true or false which is given by a single valued probability in the range 0-1.

### Generator
The generator net generates images from random noise vectors to fool the discriminator into believing that the images generated by it are part of the training set.

#### A simpler explanation..
An analogy for this system is that of a policeman and a theif. The theif attempts to counterfiet notes while the policeman determines whether the note is false or not.
This leads to a zero sum game where the policeman tries to improve his ability to find fake notes to thwart the theif while the thief improves his ability to produce counterfiet notes to fool the policeman.
***Here the generator is the theif and the discriminator is the policeman.***
